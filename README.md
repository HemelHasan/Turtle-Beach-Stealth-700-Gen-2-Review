# Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 Review
<a href="https://techstowns.com/turtle-beach-stealth-700-gen-2-review-for-gamers/" target="_blank">turtle beach stealth 700 gen 2 review</a>, For anybody seeking a premium, long-lasting headset that is also comfortable. We cannot recommend the Turtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 2 headset enough to anyone looking for a premium, long-lasting, comfortable headset: it ticks every box we look for when searching for decent tech. And, in a world where pairing headsets to Bluetooth dongles and wrestling with buttons and flaps and dials is the norm, the simplicity and ease-of-use on the Stealth 700 Gen 2 stands out a mile. It is, by some margin, one of the best PS4 headsets and best Xbox One headsets on the market at this price point.
